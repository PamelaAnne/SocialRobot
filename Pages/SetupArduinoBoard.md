# Setup Arduino Board

Take the above part.

You need the following materials to setup the breadboard:
- 4 LEDs
- 4 220 ohm resistors
- 1 10K ohm resistor
- 1 Button
- 5 black wires
- 2 red wires
- 5 yellow wires (or any other color you have)
- 1 breadbord

**Guidance advice:**

- Using red wires to VCC
- Using black wires to Ground
- Using yellow wires (or other colors) to Pins
- All black wires to (-) row first and then to GROUND
- All red wires to (+) row first and then to VCC
- Short leg of LED (-) goes to GROUND
- Long leg of LED (+) goes to resistor and then to matching Pin
- One side button to VCC
- Other side button to Pin and on same side from resistor to GROUND

**After setting up the breadboard:**

You need:
- MKR WiFi 1010 Arduino
- Micro USB Cable

Then do:
- Set red wire to VCC
- Set black wire to GROUND
- Set yellow wires to Digital Pins between 0-6
- Then connect the Arduino with the Micro USB Cable to the computer
