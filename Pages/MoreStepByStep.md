# Step 1

You need the following materials to setup the breadboard:
- 1 LEDs
- 1 220 ohm resistors
- 1 10K ohm resistor
- 1 Button
- 3 black wires
- 2 red wires
- 2 yellow wires (or any other color you have)
- 1 breadbord

**Go to https://github.com/PamelaAnne/SocialRobot to grab your Arduino code:**

Download the code with the green button in the top right corner and use the folder **StepByStepBasic_LEDS** and use file **ButtonLedNoMQTT**.

This code doesn't use yet the MQTT broker Shiftr.io and WiFi network

# Step 2

**Go to https://github.com/PamelaAnne/SocialRobot to grab your Arduino code:**

Download the code with the green button in the top right corner and use the folder **StepByStepBasic_LEDS** and use file **ButtonLed**.

This code does use the MQTT broker Shiftr.io and WiFi network

# Step 3

You need the following materials to setup the breadboard:
- 2 LEDs
- 2 220 ohm resistors
- 1 10K ohm resistor
- 1 Button
- 4 black wires
- 2 red wires
- 3 yellow wires (or any other color you have)
- 1 breadbord

Download the code with the green button in the top right corner and use the folder **StepByStepBasic_LEDS** and use file **ButtonLed2**.

# Step 4

You need the following materials to setup the breadboard:
- 4 LEDs
- 4 220 ohm resistors
- 1 10K ohm resistor
- 1 Button
- 5 black wires
- 2 red wires
- 5 yellow wires (or any other color you have)
- 1 breadbord
